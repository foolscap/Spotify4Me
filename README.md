Talk2Spotify4Me
===============

Implements a Widget for Spotify in the Notification Center of OS X 10.10 Yosemite and newer.

It uses the AppleScript API for Spotify to get the necesseray information and control it.

Download the project, copy the "Talk2Spotify.app" to your Applications folder and start it. In the "Today View" settings the widget may still needs manually to be added.

This latest version contains following bugfixes:
- This app does not prevent Spotify from closing anymore.
- If Spotify is closed, the widget is hidden and comes back if Spotify is started.
- No annoying start window anymore
- Renamed application to "Talk2Spotify" so it can be found faster with Spotify because it's not confused any more with Spotify itself.
