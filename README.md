Greetings again,

I have finally found the time to update the app!

It know supports again the album covers but only if you have an Internet connection and the supplied data by Spotify is correct. In the case of local music, listening without Internet or the corrupted image data from Spotify I do hide the viewobject of the cover so that you have more space for other widgets.

I do now use autolayout ... so this looks a little bit nicer but I still use the ugly play/pause, forward and back buttons (yeah, I am too lazy to change that...).

Some of you maybe had noticed that it's sometimes hard to read the complete title or name of the album. I made the text selectable and scrollable, so if you try to select the text from left to right you are able to read it complete. I would have liked to use tooltips but they are not supported in widgets. :-(

I hope you enjoy it and as always if you have questions or bugs to mention, just write it in the issues.

==========

Implements a Widget for Spotify in the Notification Center of OS X 10.10 Yosemite

It uses the AppleScript API for Spotify to get the necesseray information and control it.

Watch Screenshot.tiff for preview.

Download the project, copy the "SpotifyMain.app" to your Applications folder and start it. Maybe in "Today View" settings the widget still needs to manually added.

If you have already installed one version restart the Mac, replace the old SpofityMain.app with the new one and start it.
